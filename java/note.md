# Java
## JDK
- Java Development Kit (JDK) - Development Tools --> Java Runtime Environment (JRE) - Libraries and classes --> Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- Java 11 LST or Java 12.

## Object-Oriented Programming
- OOP is governed by four main principles:
    - Inheritance: how we can reuse code by using hierarchies of classes and inheriting behavior from derived classes.
    - Encapsulation: how we can hide the implementation details from the outside world while providing a consistent interface to communicate with our objects through methods.
    - Abstraction: how we can focus on the important details of an object and ignore the other details.
    - Polymorphism: how we can define abstract behaviors and let other classes provide implementations for these behaviors.
- In Java, everything except primitive data types are objects.
    ```java
    modifier class ClassName {
        // Body
  }
    ```
- __Modifires__: a class can be public, private, protected, or have no modifier.
    - `public` class is accessible from other classes in other packages.
    - `private` class is only accessible from within the class it is declared.
    - `protected` class member is accessible within all classes in the same package.
- __ClassName__: the name should begin with an initial letter
- __Body__: where we define the properties and methods of the class.
